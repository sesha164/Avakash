    <h1>About Avakash</h1>
    <p>Connecting Rural Talent with Opportunities</p>
  </header>

  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      At <strong>Avakash</strong>, we believe that meaningful work should not depend on where you live.
      Rural communities often face limited access to skill development, centralized job information,
      and career support. This leads to underemployment and loss of local talent.
    </p>
    <p>
      To solve this, Avakash was created as a <strong>dedicated rural job searching platform</strong>.
      It connects job seekers with opportunities in agriculture, education, small businesses, and
      various local industries. We make the process simple, transparent, and accessible for all.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- MISSION -->
  <section>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Our mission is to <strong>empower rural communities</strong> by making job opportunities more
      accessible, inclusive, and reliable. We aim to strengthen local economies by helping people
      find work close to home and reducing the need for migration to cities.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- OBJECTIVES -->
  <section>
    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Connect rural job seekers with opportunities that match their skills.</li>
      <li>Support small and medium rural enterprises in hiring skilled workers.</li>
      <li>Provide a user-friendly, simple interface for all age groups.</li>

    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- MOTIVATION -->
  <section>
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      Rural communities often lack centralized access to job resources, career counseling,
      or market insights. Many talented individuals remain unnoticed simply because they
      don’t have access to proper platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Avakash aims to change this by combining <strong>localized job data</strong> with
      <strong>technology</strong>. We want to give rural job seekers clarity, confidence,
      and real opportunities right at their doorstep.
    </p>
  </section>
